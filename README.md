## 2. Workload Split

1. **Frontend** â€“ Lecturer dashboard, student join page, charts, responsive UI  
2. **Backend** â€“ REST APIs, WebSocket vote handling, validation  
3. **Database** â€“ PostgreSQL schema, constraints, Redis â†’ DB persistence  
4. **DevOps** â€“ Azure App Service, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD  
5. **Testing / QA** â€“ Cypress E2E (poll creation, voting, export), k6 load tests (TBD)  
6. **Compliance / Security** â€“ POPIA checks, PII handling  
7. **Project Management** â€“ Sprint planning, GitHub repo/branch strategy, coordination

### Work Distribution:
Probable split: 2 frontend, 3 backend and 2 database. Brackets are based on previous poll.

- Mariska: (front end, backend)
- Eugene: (backend)
- Alfred: (backend)

## 3. Key Notes for Meeting

- âœ… Confirm scope: guest poll flow only  
- âœ… Lock in tech stack: **React + Node/Express + Socket.io + PostgreSQL + Redis + Azure**  
- âœ… Assign roles (see workload split)  
- âœ… Setup GitHub repo + branching strategy (`main`, `dev`, `feature/*`)
-  v/ Repo is set up by FC so check if he invited everyone
- âœ… Define "Done": reviewed, tested, deployed to staging  
- âœ… Draft UAT test cases from functional requirements  
- âœ… Plan Sprint 1 (2â€“3 weeks): deliver guest polling demo

**DEADLINE IS 29 SEPT - 3 OCT**
